Context is the state of the blockchain. The most common implementation of a state machine is a database. The important difference to a simple database is that a set of rules secures the state of a blockchain. The rules are codified in the [protocol](protocol). Each [operation](operations/operations) is applied to the current context. When doing so, the system moves from an old state to the new state. Remember that in Tezos context is the same as state.

A simple example is the transfer of currency or *tez* between accounts. This requires a change to the context that tracks the balance of accounts.
