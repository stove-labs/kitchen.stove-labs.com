There are 2 types of accounts in Tezos: *implicit* and *originated* accounts. An implicit account is another name for a "regular" account, as we encounter them so frequently in blockchain. On the other hand, originated accounts are basically [smart contracts](../smart_contract/smart-contract).

Both accounts share most of the same functionalities. They have account *balances* indicating how many ꜩ (tezzies) they hold, they can send and receive [transactions](operations/transaction) and call (*invoke*) smart contracts. The major difference is that originated accounts have a program code attached to it, written in [Michelson](../smart_contract/michelson) language. That code is executed, whenever the originated account receives a transaction. That makes originated accounts customizable. We will explore examples later in this article.

## Address 

An address makes an account identifiable in the network. Just using the address, you can look up the balance of the account and its whole history of [operations](operations/operations), conveniently using a *blockchain explorer*. 

For both account types the address looks slightly different. Implicit accounts always start with small letters **tz** and originated ones with capital letters **KT**. For example, `tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb` and `KT1VGRedoH7Y5VUhesSTJFK3gnXsfZpXcngf` respectively. 

The shape of the address is defined by a simple formula. It starts with `tz` or `KT` and is followed by the signature scheme *1*, *2* or *3* and the hash of the public key. As Tezos' development progressed, updates to the codebase added new cryptograhpic algorithms, hence the various signature schemes. The hashing function applied to the [public key](cryptography/key-pair) is *Blake2b*. We have a separate section devoted to *cryptography* and it explains how to get from a secret-key to the address.

The 3 signature schemes for implicit accounts depend on the elliptic curves used, in particular:

- `tz1` for Ed25519
- `tz2` for Secp256k1 (ECDSA)
- `tz3` for NIST P256 (ECDSA) 


:::note 
Implicit accounts are all backwards compatible. They can send each other tezzies without any problems.

## Authentication

Now the question arises - who controls the account? The concept of the secret-key that forms a [key-pair](cryptography/key-pair) with the public key is very important in the blockchain space. Generally speaking, [signatures](cryptography/signature) are used to *authenticate* and *authorize* between the client (the user) and the server (the blockchain node), whenever a new [operation](operations/operations) is performed. Whoever is in possession of the secret-key, gains access to the account. This is the reason the secret-key needs to be protected.

This general explanation only applies to *implicit* accounts. For *originated* accounts it works differently with almost endless possibilities, because the behaviour can be programed in its smart contract code. For example, for an originated account to send tezzies, it needs to have the transfer functionality programed. For example, the code could check for *access control**. It checks whether the sender of the instruction belongs to a whitelist of addresses. This can be extended by more complex business logic. There are attempts to build so called [decentralized autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) (DAOs). Please feel free to read up on this very interesting application for smart contracts, unfortunately it goes beyond the scope of this article to explain it.

:::danger
Sending ꜩ (tezzies) to an originated account will get lost, if its smart contract code does not have logic implemented to transfer tezzies. The [smart contracts section](../smart_contract/smart-contract) examines a solution to automatically decline token transfers.
