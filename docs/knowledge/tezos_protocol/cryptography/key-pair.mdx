To control your [account](address) in the blockchain you need to have access to the *seed* or *secret key*. It is good practice to have a backup of the seed and therefore often a selection of words from a dictionary (seed phrases). The seed is then hashed and the resulting string of characters forms the secret key. 
Next a so called key pair is derived using a mathematical function. As the name suggests, the key pair consists of two keys: the secret key (also *private key*) and public key. For each key there is only one other matching key that is calculated by elliptic curve multiplication in Tezos. Similar to hashing, this only goes one-way. You can derive from a secret key the corresponding public key, but not the other way around. 
Every Tezos [address](address) of an implicit account starts with `tz` followed by either `1`,`2` or `3` and the *hash of the public key*.  Originated accounts always start with capital letters `KT`.

The 3 signature schemes for implicit accounts depend on the elliptic curves used, in particular:

- `tz1` for Ed25519
- `tz2` for Secp256k1 (ECDSA)
- `tz3` for NIST P256 (ECDSA) 

:::danger
Keep the **seed** and **secret key** always to yourself. Never share it with anyone, otherwise someone else will gain access to your account.

:::tip
Do not mix up *pk* with private key. Common abbreviations in the Tezos ecosystem and often seen in `.config` files are:
* **pkh** = **p**ublic **k**ey **h**ash
* **sk** = **s**ecret **k**ey
* **pk** = **p**ublic **k**ey
