A reveal operation is a special type of [operation](operations). It *reveals* the public key linked to the [address](../cryptography/address) (public key hash) of an [implicit account](../implicit-account). This operation happens when the first transaction is sent **from** the account. The public key is important for other participants to verify operations signed from the specific account.

Whenever a transaction is sent **to** a new implicit account, then the [context](../context) of the blockchain is increased and a fixed storage burn of 0.257ꜩ needs to be paid. More about different types of fees in the [gas & fees article](gas-fees).
