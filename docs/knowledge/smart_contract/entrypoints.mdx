In Tezos there are two different types of [accounts](../tezos_protocol/account): *implicit* and *originated*. The latter is an account with [Michelson](michelson) code attached to it and is basically known as [smart contract](smart-contract). It can be seen as a *collection of functions* that share and manipulate the same storage. Different to implicit accounts, originated accounts can receive more than just êœ© in a [transaction](../tezos_protocol/operations/transaction), namely **parameters** that are consumed when executing the code. Those parameters always first arrive at the main function of the code.

The challenge is how to address specific functions from the "outside", while parameters are always passed to the main function? That's why we have so called 
**entrypoints** that work like the following: variants of parameters get matched and routed to the functions we want to address. In this way, entrypoints make functions explicitly callable from the outside of the smart contract.

## Example from the workshop

In the [notarization workshop](../../learn/workshops/notarization/overview) the smart contract as seen [here](https://github.com/stove-labs/workshop-notarization/blob/dev/smart-contracts/contracts/main/notary.religo), exposes two functions with the help of entrypoints:

1. NotarizeDocument(**notarizeParameter**): It takes a new document hash to notarize.
2. SignDocument(**signParameter**): This signs an existing document.

The chart below shows how both variants of the parameters are matched in the main function of the smart contract. They are passed to the two different functions *signDocument* and *notarizeDocument* and are processed there. As you can see, the exposed functions are calling within the smart contract other functions, which are not exposed to the outside.

    addDocument["addDocumentHashWithSigneesToNotary()"]

    addDocument-->|calls internally|getEmpty
  end
`}/>

We can also look at the code that does this matching. It is written in [Ligo](https://www.ligolang.org) in the *ReasonLIGO* flavor. 

```reason
/**
 * Unique set of addresses which will be able
 * to co-sign the document.
 */
type signees = set(signee);
/**
 * Parameter for the `NotarizeDocument` entrypoint,
 * accepting a hash to be notarized along with a set of signees.
 */
type notarizeParameter = {
    documentHash: documentHash,
    signees: signees
};

type action = 
    /**
     * Propose a new document hash to notarize
     */
    | NotarizeDocument(notarizeParameter)
    /**
     * Sign an existing document with a new signature
     */
    | SignDocument(signParameter);
/**
 * Main function representing the Notary contract
 */
let main = ((action, storage): (action, storage)) : entrypointReturn => 
  /**
   * Entrypoint routing
   */
  switch (action) {
    | NotarizeDocument(notarizeParameter) => notarizeDocument(notarizeParameter, storage);
    | SignDocument(signParameter) => signDocument(signParameter, storage);
  }
```
