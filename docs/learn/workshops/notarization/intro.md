Welcome to this self-paced workshop about notarization. Before jumping into the matter, what does it actually mean to **notarize** a document? Usually a notary places a seal or stamp on a document, demonstrating that he or she has witnessed the signing of the document. This **verfication of witness** is needed to give them legal weight by independently verifing important documents. For example, this would be the case for a couple signing a large mortage contract that is used to buy a house.

Readup the definition of notarization in the [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notarize) dictionary.

Following this tutorial, you are first going to learn how to **time-stamp** a digital document. A time-stamp is a proof that a specific file existed at a certain point in time. Such a service is not new, but forms the foundation of our solution. We will learn that every file has a digital **fingerprint** that is many times smaller than the document itself. That becomes useful, because we will save that fingerprint in the blockchain [ledger](). We do not stop at this simple process, but will add features that enable multiple people to interact with the document. Like in the real-world use case of notarization!

:::note
The document you want to notarize can be any digital file. Examples of documents that get notarized between two or more parties are: 
- **lease agreement**: tenant and landlord
- license agreement: author and publisher
- service level agreement: provider and consumer
- intellectual property rights: inventor(s)
