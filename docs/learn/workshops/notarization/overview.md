</div>

In this self-paced workshop you are going to learn how to **notarize** any digital file using the Tezos blockchain. You will leverage the properties of blockchain technology, specifically auditability and immutability, to timestamp documents *and* to use the blockchain as a decentralized *witness* verifying the signature of multiple parties.

After completing this workshop you will be able to:

- Make sense of a real-life use case: notarization with blockchain
- Understand the basics of the Tezos blockchain platform
- Design, implement and test smart contracts
- Perform tests on a private network
- Deploy smart contracts to the public test-network
- Interact with smart contracts from a browser programmatically
